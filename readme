--MORE LIKE MY NOTE TOSELF --
** first time usng MongoDB and Mongoose with NodeJS **

so, what I did was the following....

1. starting with making sure mongod.exe (server) is running and mongo.exe is on ( nothing to do with it really? )
2. create folder somewhere make sure you have server.js, views, static (same thing all the time)
3. see server.js for all the code
4. making sure everything runs property in node.js (i like using nodemon)
5. you should be good to go :)
